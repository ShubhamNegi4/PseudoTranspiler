# PseudoTranspiler
ðŸ”§ Converts pseudocode to Python using compiler design principles.


## APPROACH : 
1.	Input  : We begin with a well-defined grammar and syntax for our pseudocode language (inspired by common educational styles like pseudocode) which will be inputed from terminal / file / web app
2.	 Lexical Analysis : Using this grammar, we will implement a lexical analyzer using Pythonâ€™sâ€¯reâ€¯module or libraries likeâ€¯PLY.lex (Python Lex-Yacc)â€¯to tokenize the input into well defined tokens of the language. 
3.	Syntax Analysis :These tokens will be passed to a parser built with PLY.yacc or a custom parser ( top down or bottom up) that constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the structure of the pseudocode.
4.	Semantic Analysis  :The semantic analyzer will traverse the AST to perform type checks, scope validation, and other logical validations using symbol tables. 
5.	Code Generation : Once verified, the code generation phase will translate the AST into clean, equivalent Python code using a template-based or tree-walk approac
